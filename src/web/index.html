  <p>
  Play an immigrant on the newly populated island of Catan. Build
  settlements, roads, and cities by taking commodities from the land
  around you. Turn a sheep, lumber, rocks and some grain into a
  settlement, bricks and wood into road, or try to complete other
  combinations for more advanced buildings and services. Take
  advantage of trades with other players, or at local seaports to get
  commodities you might lack. The first player to gain 10 points from
  a combination of roads, settlements, and special cards wins.

  <p>
  To play, enter a nickname and then either enter a new name for a
  game, or double click on a game in the list to join it.  Be patient
  when you join a game, it takes a while to load.  If you try to join
  a game, and there is someone in the game with the same nickname as
  yours, it won't work.  Just enter a new nickname and try again.

  <p>
  This applet is based on a board game that you can buy from the good
  people at <a href="http://www.catan.com/game/settlers-catan">Catan GmbH</a>
  and <a href="http://mayfairgames.com/">Mayfair Games</a>.
