# Reminders about .properties filenames and format:
# - For a locale, the filename is bundlename_lang.properties or (more specific) bundlename_lang_COUNTRY.properties,
#    where lang and country are 2 or 3 characters each.  Keys not found there must be in bundlename.properties.
# - Logically related keys are grouped together in the files, with blank lines separating the groups.
#    Keys within a group might be alphabetical or chronological (based on usual game play).  The groups are ordered
#    in the file with common groups first, then mostly chronologically, then rarely used groups near the end of the file.  
# - Key names are case-sensitive; jsettlers uses mostly-lowercase alphanumeric keys, and "." to organize keys into hierarchies.
# - Keys about game options and scenarios should contain their name (.sc_piri., etc)
# - Keys which should not be localized must start with _nolocaliz
# - Parsing a key = value pair, the whitespace around "=" is stripped, but a value's trailing whitespace is kept.  If a
#    value begins with whitespace, use backslash to escape that.  For more info see the java.util.Properties.load javadoc.
#    Best practice in jsettlers is to not use leading or trailing whitespace unless unavoidable, and always comment the
#    reason in the java code and above the properties key-value pair.
# - The encoding must be ISO-8859-1, not UTF-8; see the java.util.Properties javadoc for details.
#    Backslashes must be doubled.  Tab, newline and carriage return are encoded as in Java strings (backslash-t, backslash-n, etc)
#
# Reminders about the format used for text with arguments by SOCStringManager.get and MessageFormat.format:
# - Message argument numbers start at 0: It''s {0}''s turn to roll the dice.
# - Message arguments can have a format type: {0} rolled a {1,number}.  See java.text.MessageFormat javadoc.
# - JSettlers has special types parsed by SOCStringManager.getSpecial, see its javadoc: {0,list}, {0,rsrcs}, etc
# - When a message has an argument:
#     - Single-quote characters must be doubled: ''
#     - Left curly brackets must be single-quoted: '{'
#   Messages without arguments shouldn't double single-quotes or quote { brackets.

gameopt.PL = Maximum # players
gameopt.PLB = Use 6-player board
gameopt.SBL = Use sea board
gameopt.RD = Robber can't return to the desert
gameopt.N7 = Roll no 7s during first # rounds

# Scenario game option names:
#    At the client, NewGameOptionsFrame.showScenarioInfoDialog() assumes scenario game options
#    all start with the text "Scenarios:". When localizing, be sure to keep a consistent prefix

#    See also gameopt._SC_*
gamescen.SC_4ISL.n = The Four Islands
gamescen.SC_CLVI.n = Cloth Trade with neutral villages
gamescen.SC_CLVI.d = The small islands' villages give you Cloth; every 2 cloth you have is 1 extra Victory Point. To gain cloth, build ships to a village. Each player to reach a village gets 1 of its cloth at that time, and 1 more whenever its number is rolled, until the village runs out. You can't move the pirate until you've reached a village. If more than half the villages run out of cloth, the game ends and the player with the most VP wins. (If tied, player with most cloth wins.)
gamescen.SC_FOG.n = Fog Islands
gamescen.SC_FOG.d = Some hexes are initially hidden by fog. When you build a ship or road to a foggy hex, that hex is revealed. Unless it's water, you are given its resource as a reward.
gamescen.SC_FTRI.n = The Forgotten Tribe
gamescen.SC_FTRI.d = Far areas of the board have small habitations of a "forgotten tribe" of settlers. When players build ships to reach them, they are greeted with "gifts" of a development card, Special Victory Point, or a Port given to the player which must be moved adjacent to one of their coastal settlements/cities if possible, or set aside to place later.
gamescen.SC_NSHO.n = New Shores
gamescen.SC_PIRI.n = Pirate Islands and Fortresses
gamescen.SC_PIRI.d = A pirate fleet patrols, stealing resources from weak players with adjacent settlements/cities until the player upgrades their ships to warships.  To win, you must build ships directly to the Fortress with your color, which the pirates have captured from you, and defeat it 3 times using warships.  So, ship routes can't branch in different directions, only extend from their ends.  No robber or largest army.
gamescen.SC_TTD.n = Through The Desert
gamescen.SC_WOND.n = Wonders
gamescen.SC_WOND.d = Each player must choose a unique Wonder and build all 4 of its levels. Each Wonder has its own requirements before you may start it, such as a port at a location or the number of cities built. To win, you must complete your Wonder's 4 levels, or reach 10 VP and complete more levels than any other player.
