/**
 * Server class to handle game-specific actions and messages for a type of game.
 *<P>
 * Currently, these concepts are common to all hosted game types:
 *<UL>
 * <LI> A game has members (clients) who are each a player or observer
 * <LI> Some players may be bots
 * <LI> Human players sit down (choosing a player number) before starting the game
 * <LI> Some player positions (seats) may be locked so a bot won't sit there
 * <LI> Once a human player decides to start the game, randomly chosen bots join and sit down in unlocked empty seats
 * <LI> Games can be new, starting, active, or over
 * <LI> Once started, games have a current player
 * <LI> If bots' turns or actions take too long, can force the end of their turn
 * <LI> Game board can be reset to a new game with the same settings and players (bots, if any, are randomly chosen again).
 *      See {@link SOCGame#resetAsCopy()} and {@link SOCGameListAtServer#resetBoard(String)}.
 *</UL>
 *
 * Interface and interaction:
 *<UL>
 * <LI> The {@link SOCServer} manages the "boundary" of the game: The list of all games;
 *      joining and leaving players and bots; creating and destroying games; game start time and the board reset framework.
 * <LI> Every server/client interaction about the game, including startup and end-game details, player actions and
 *      requests, and ending a player's turn, is taken care of within the {@code GameHandler} and {@link SOCGame}.
 *      Game reset details are handled by {@link SOCGame#resetAsCopy()}.
 * <LI> Actions and requests from players arrive here via {@link #processCommand(SOCGame, SOCMessageForGame, StringConnection)},
 *      called for each {@link SOCMessageForGame} sent to the server about this handler's game.
 * <LI> Communication to game members is done by handler methods calling server methods
 *      such as {@link SOCServer#messageToGame(String, soc.message.SOCMessage)}
 *      or {@link SOCServer#messageToPlayer(StringConnection, soc.message.SOCMessage)}.
 *</UL>
