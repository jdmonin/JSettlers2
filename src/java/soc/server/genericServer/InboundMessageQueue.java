/**
 *
 * this is one of the main class in the messaging infrastructure implemented in the {@link Server}
 * <P>
 *
 * The main target of this class is to store all the inbound {@link SOCMessage} in text format received from the server by the client connected
 * and solicit the server to  processing the message
 *
 * <P>
 * The internal implementation of the {@link InboundMessageQueue} use an internal thread implemented by the inner class {@link Treater} to process the messages received
 * in the queue and solicit the {@link Server} using the method {@link Server#processCommand(String, StringConnection)}
 *
 * <P>
 * to initialize {@link InboundMessageQueue} use the constructor {@link #SOCInboundMessageQueue(Server)}.
 * This constructor will start only the behavior of the SOCInboundMessageQueue of receive the messages.... <br>
 * To start the processing of the message you have to call {@link #startMessageProcessing()} when the {@link Server} is ready to process the messages.
 *
 * <P>
 * Actually this class is used  by the {@link StringConnection} instances and derived instances classes to store the new message received.<br>
 * The method used to put messages in this queue is {@link #pushMessageInTheQueue(String, StringConnection)} <br>
 * the implementation of the  {@link InboundMessageQueue} use an internal thread-safe implementation queue, so it doesn't need to be synchronized
 *
 * <P>
 * The {@link InboundMessageQueue} must be stopped when the {@link Server} owner of this queue is stopped calling {@link #stopMessageProcessing()}.<br>
 * This will stop also the {@link Treater} instance of this queue
 *
 * <UL>
 * <LI> See {@link SOCMessage} for details of the client/server protocol messaging.
 * <LI> See {@link StringConnection} for details of the client/server communication.
 * <LI> See {@link Server#processCommand(String, StringConnection)} for details of the message processing.
