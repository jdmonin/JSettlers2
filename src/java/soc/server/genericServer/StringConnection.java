 *
 *<PRE>
 *  1.0.0 - 2007-11-18 - initial release
 *  1.0.1 - 2008-06-28 - add getConnectTime
 *  1.0.2 - 2008-07-30 - no change in this file
 *  1.0.3 - 2008-08-08 - add disconnectSoft, getVersion, setVersion
 *  1.0.4 - 2008-09-04 - add appData
 *  1.0.5 - 2009-05-31 - add isVersionKnown, setVersion(int,bool),
 *                       setVersionTracking, isInputAvailable,
 *                       wantsHideTimeoutMessage, setHideTimeoutMessage
 *  1.0.5.1- 2009-10-26- javadoc warnings fixed; remove unused import EOFException
 *  1.2.0 - 2013-09-07 - for I18N, add {@link #setI18NStringManager(SOCStringManager, String)} and
 *                       {@link #getLocalized(String)}. StringConnection is now a superclass, not an interface.
