/**
 * Symmetric buffered connection sending strings between two local peers.
 * Uses vectors and thread synchronization, no actual network traffic.
 *<P>
 * This class has a run method, but you must start the thread yourself.
 * Constructors will not create or start a thread.
 *<P>
 * As used within JSettlers, the structure of this class has much in common
 * with {@link Connection}, as they both implement the {@link StringConnection}
 * interface.  If you add something to one class (or to StringConnection),
 * you should probably add it to the other.
 *
 *<PRE>
 *  1.0.0 - 2007-11-18 - initial release
 *  1.0.1 - 2008-06-28 - add getConnectTime
 *  1.0.2 - 2008-07-30 - check if s already null in disconnect
 *  1.0.3 - 2008-08-08 - add disconnectSoft, getVersion, setVersion
 *  1.0.4 - 2008-09-04 - add appData
 *  1.0.5 - 2009-05-31 - add isVersionKnown, setVersion(int,bool), setVersionTracking,
 *                       isInputAvailable, callback to processFirstCommand,
 *                       wantsHideTimeoutMessage, setHideTimeoutMessage;
 *                       common constructor code moved to init().
 *  1.0.5.1- 2009-10-26- javadoc warnings fixed
 *  1.0.5.2- 2010-04-05- add toString for debugging
