/**
 * A class for holding and manipulating game data.
 * Most methods are not implicitly thread-safe;
 * call {@link #takeMonitor()} and {@link #releaseMonitor()} around them.
 *<P>
 * The model in this client/server game is: The SOCGame at server contains the game's
 * complete state information, and game logic advances there.
 * Each client's local SOCGame contains only partial state (for instance, other
 * players' resources or devel cards may be of unknown type); and the server directly
 * updates clients' game state by sending messages such as
 * {@link soc.message.SOCGameState} and {@link soc.message.SOCSetPlayedDevCard}.
 * Within this package, you can check {@link #isAtServer}.
 *<P>
 * Many methods assume you've already checked whether the move is valid,
 * and won't check it a second time.  For example, {@link #canPlayKnight(int)}
 * should be called to check before calling {@link #playKnight()}.
 *<P>
 * For the board <b>coordinate system and terms</b> (hex, node, edge), see the
 * {@link SOCBoard} class javadoc.
 *<P>
 * Games are created at the server in {@link soc.server.SOCGameListAtServer} and given an
 * expiration time 90 minutes away
 * ({@link soc.server.SOCGameListAtServer#GAME_TIME_EXPIRE_MINUTES SOCGameListAtServer.GAME_TIME_EXPIRE_MINUTES}).
 * Players then choose their seats, optionally locking empty seats against joining robots,
 * and any player can click the Start Game button.
 *<P>
 * Game play begins with the server calling {@link #startGame()}, then sending messages to clients
 * with the starting game state and player data and a board layout.
 * After initial placement, normal play begins with the first player's turn, in state {@link #PLAY};
 * {@link #updateAtGameFirstTurn()} is called for any work needed.
 *<P>
 * During game play, {@link #putPiece(SOCPlayingPiece)} and other game-action methods update {@code gameState}.
 * {@link #updateAtTurn()}, <tt>putPiece</tt> and some other game-action methods update {@link #lastActionTime}.
 *<P>
 * The game's current plays and actions are tracked through game states, such as
 * {@value #START1A} or {@link #WAITING_FOR_DISCARDS}.  A normal turn starts at {@link #PLAY};
 * after dice are rolled, the turn will spend most of its time in {@link #PLAY1}.  If you need to
 * add a state, please see the instructions at {@link #NEW}.
 *<P>
 * The winner is the player who has {@link #vp_winner} or more victory points (typically 10)
 * on their own turn.  Some optional game scenarios have special win conditions, see {@link #checkForWinner()}.
 *<P>
 * The {@link SOCGame#hasSeaBoard large sea board} features scenario events.
 * To listen for these, call {@link #setScenarioEventListener(SOCScenarioEventListener)}.
 * If the game has a scenario, its {@link SOCGameOption}s will include {@code "SC"}, possibly along with
 * other options whose key names start with {@code "_SC_"}.

     * This method is called from other game methods which may award VPs or may cause a win,
     * such as {@link #buyDevCard()} and {@link #putPiece(SOCPlayingPiece)}, and at the start
     * of each turn by {@link #endTurn()} under some conditions (see that method).
     *<P>
     * Per rules FAQ, a player can win only during their own turn.
     * If a player reaches winning points ({@link #vp_winner} or more) but it's
     * not their turn, there is not yet a winner. This could happen if,
     * for example, the longest road is broken by a new settlement, and
     * the next-longest road is not the current player's road.
     *<P>
     * The win is determined not by who has the highest point total, but
     * solely by reaching enough victory points ({@link #vp_winner}) during your own turn.
     *<P>
     * Some game scenarios have other special win conditions ({@link #hasScenarioWinCondition}):
     *<UL>
     *<LI> Scenario {@link SOCGameOption#K_SC_CLVI _SC_CLVI} will end the game if
     *     less than half the {@link SOCVillage}s have cloth remaining.  The player
     *     with the most VP wins; if tied, the tied player with the most cloth wins.
     *     The winner is not necessarily the current player.
     *<LI> Scenario {@link SOCGameOption#K_SC_PIRI _SC_PIRI} requires the player to
     *     defeat and recapture 'their' pirate fortress to win.
     *<LI> Scenario {@link SOCGameOption#K_SC_WOND _SC_WOND} requires the player to
     *     build a Wonder to a higher level than any other player's Wonder; the player
     *     can win even without reaching {@link #vp_winner} VP.
