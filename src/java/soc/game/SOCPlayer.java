/**
 * A class for holding and manipulating player data.
 * The player exists within one SOCGame, not persistent between games like SOCPlayerClient or SOCClientData.
 *<P>
 * At the start of each player's turn, {@link SOCGame#updateAtTurn()} will call {@link SOCPlayer#updateAtTurn()},
 * then call the current player's {@link #updateAtOurTurn()}.
 *<P>
 * For more information about the "legal" and "potential" road/settlement/city terms,
 * see page 61 of Robert S Thomas' dissertation.  Briefly:
 * "Legal" locations are where pieces can be placed, according to the game rules.
 * "Potential" locations are where pieces can be placed <em>soon</em>, based on the
 * current state of the game board.  For example, every legal settlement location is
 * also a potential settlement during initial placement (game state {@link SOCGame#START1A START1A}
 * through {@link SOCGame#START2A START2A}.  Once the player's second settlement is placed,
 * all potential settlement locations are cleared.  Only when they build 2 connected road
 * segments, will another potential settlement location be set.
 *<P>
 * If the board layout changes from game to game, as with {@link SOCLargeBoard} /
 * {@link SOCBoard#BOARD_ENCODING_LARGE}, use these methods to update the player's board data
 * after {@link SOCBoard#makeNewBoard(Hashtable)}, in this order:
 *<UL>
 * <LI> {@link #getPlayerNumber()}.{@link SOCPlayerNumbers#setLandHexCoordinates(int[]) setLandHexCoordinates(int[])}
 * <LI> {@link #setPotentialAndLegalSettlements(Collection, boolean, HashSet[])}
 *</UL>
 *<P>
 * On the {@link SOCLargeBoard large sea board}, our list of the player's roads also
 * contains their ships.  They are otherwise treated separately.
