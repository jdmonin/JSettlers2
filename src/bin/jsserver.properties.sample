# Sample jsserver.properties file with descriptions:
# See bottom of file for copyright and license information (GPLv3).
#
# All JSettlers Server properties and their defaults are given here.
# Boolean flag properties' values are shown here as =Y or =N; you can
# use =T or =F instead, and flag values aren't case-sensitive.
# You can also get a brief description of all properties by running
#	java -jar JSettlersServer.jar --help
#
# To use a properties file with the server, name it jsserver.properties
# and place it in the directory where the JSettlers Server will run.
# Remove the leading comment character ("#") from the line of any property that
# you want to change from its default value. The file is read at startup,
# but not re-read afterwards if it's updated. Any server option given on
# the command line overrides the same option's value in the properties file.
# To determine if the server is reading the properties file, look for this text
# near the start of the console output:
#   Reading startup properties from jsserver.properties

# -- Beginning of list of recognized available properties --

# TCP port number for server to listen for client connections.
# jsettlers.port=8880

# Maximum connection count, including robots: The number of client players
# who can connect is (jsettlers.connections - jsettlers.startrobots).
# This default value's goal is to prevent overloading the server's capacity;
# large busy servers will want to set it higher and monitor cpu and memory use.
# jsettlers.connections=40

# Number of robots to create at startup. About 30% will be "smart" robots, the
# other 70% will be "fast" robots. Each robot can play in many games at once.
# jsettlers.startrobots=7

# Per-client limits:

# Maximum simultaneous games that a client can create.
# Once a game is completed and deleted (all players leave), they can create
# another. Set this to -1 for no limit; 0 will disallow any game creation.
# This limit is ignored for practice games, which run on the client and have
# no impact on server resources or other clients.
# jsettlers.client.maxcreategames=5

# Maximum simultaneous chat channels that a client can create.
# Once a channel is deleted (all members leave), they can create another.
# Set this to -1 for no limit; 0 will disallow any chat channel creation.
# jsettlers.client.maxcreatechannels=2

# Game option defaults:
# To change a Game Option default for new games, for example to activate the
# house rule "Robber can't return to the desert", set a property named
# jsettlers.gameopt. + the name and value:
#   jsettlers.gameopt.RD=y
# The game option values use the same syntax as the command line; see
# README.txt section "Parameters and game option defaults".
# You can also get a list of all default game option values by running
#	java -jar JSettlersServer.jar --help
# Note the format of those default values: Some options are shown as "(INTBOOL)"
# and need both a true/false flag and a numeric value. For example, to change
# the default winning victory points to 12:
#   jsettlers.gameopt.vp=t12

# Optional User Database:
# JSettlers can optionally use a database for game scores and/or user accounts
# ("nicknames" and passwords). Here are the properties for server features
# which require a database, then those for the database connection details.
# For more info see README.txt section "Database Setup".

# - DB: Server features:

# Flag to save all games in DB: Game name, start time, players, final scores.
# jsettlers.db.save.games=N

# Flag to require all players to have a user account and password. By default,
# this is not set and any client can make up their own name to use in games
# while connected, so long as that name isn't already taken by a user account
# in the database.
# jsettlers.accounts.required=N

# Flag to permit open self-registration of new user accounts. By default, this
# is not set and clients can't anonymously create accounts: Must log in first.
# jsettlers.accounts.open=N

# If not blank, permit only these usernames to create accounts (comma-separated
# list of usernames). By default any user account can log in to create others.
# Also, only Account Admin Users can run user-related commands; see README.txt
# section "Security and Admin Users".
# Reminder if using non-ascii characters in admin usernames: Remember that java
# properties files are encoded in ISO-8859-1 not UTF-8 because of backwards
# compatibility; you may want to create a separate admin-only account with a
# simpler ascii-only name.
# jsettlers.accounts.admins=...  # blank by default

# Player account password encryption: BCrypt Work Factor
# For tuning, BCrypt includes a "Work Factor" parameter; the hashing algorithm
# runs for 2 ^ WorkFactor rounds, so a larger Work Factor is tougher to
# brute-force attack but runs slower on your server.
# Each account's Work Factor is stored with its encrypted password; changing the
# Work Factor property affects future passwords but not already-encrypted ones.
# To test the speed of different work factors on your server, run
# JSettlersServer once with -Djsettlers.db.bcrypt.work_factor=test , which will
# try a range of work factors and print the timed results.
# jsettlers.db.bcrypt.work_factor=12

# - DB connection:

# Username for logging into the database server
# jsettlers.db.user=socuser

# Password for logging into the database server
# jsettlers.db.pass=socpass

# DB connection URL for JDBC. The format is specific to the DB type
# you've chosen for your database server and specifies the type,
# server hostname, and db name.
# Default, for MySQL named socdata hosted on localhost:
#   jsettlers.db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/socdata
# For Postgresql hosted on localhost:
#   jsettlers.db.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/socdata
# For a SQLite file in the current directory:
#   jsettlers.db.url=jdbc:sqlite:jsettlers.sqlite

# DB driver JAR filename. The driver JAR default is blank, since the filename
# varies by database type and version. The driver JAR should usually be placed
# in the same directory as the JSettlersServer JAR, because of Java's
# restrictions about JARs loading other JARs. You will probably need to
# download the driver JAR for your DB type; see README.txt for URLs.
# jsettlers.db.jar=...    # (Blank by default)

# JDBC DB driver class name. Common DB types will automatically set this
# based on the database type prefix in jsettlers.db.url:
#   mysql ->    com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
#   postgres -> org.postgresql.Driver
#   sqlite ->   org.sqlite.JDBC
# If you're using another DB type, or that driver class has changed since this
# jsettlers version was released, you must specify the JDBC driver class name.
# jsettlers.db.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver

# Debug Options for developers:

# Flag to allow remote debug commands over TCP connections, from a user named
# "debug". If you set this, for security you should use sqlite or another
# database type and create the debug user there with a password.
# Practice games always allow debug commands, since those aren't multiplayer.
# When this flag is set, the server version banner shown at connect includes
# the text "debugging is on". For debug command info, login as debug and type
# *help*; see also README.developer.
# jsettlers.allow.debug=N

# Specify the robot connect cookie string. By default a new random string is
# generated each time the server runs. Bots can't connect without giving the
# cookie string to the server; without that cookie they are treated as human
# players and won't be invited to join games. This debug property is useful
# when developing or using a robot which isn't run within the server JVM.
# If specified, this string must not contain any '|' ',' or newline characters.
# jsettlers.bots.cookie=???   ## no default, randomly generated if not specified

# Flag to print the value of jsettlers.bots.cookie to stderr during server
# startup. If set, the cookie output will appear in this format:
#   Robot cookie: 03883269284ee140cb907ea203846333
# jsettlers.bots.showcookie=N
