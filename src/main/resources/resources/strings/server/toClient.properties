# Reminders about .properties filenames and format:
# - For a locale, the filename is bundlename_lang.properties or (more specific) bundlename_lang_COUNTRY.properties,
#    where lang and country are 2 or 3 characters each.  Keys not found there must be in bundlename.properties.
# - Logically related keys are grouped together in the files, with blank lines separating the groups.
#    Keys within a group might be alphabetical or chronological (based on usual game play).  The groups are ordered
#    in the file with common groups first, then mostly chronologically, then rarely used groups near the end of the file.  
# - Key names are case-sensitive; jsettlers uses mostly-lowercase alphanumeric keys, and "." to organize keys into hierarchies.
# - Keys about game options and scenarios should contain their name (.sc_piri., etc)
# - Keys which should not be localized must start with _nolocaliz
# - Parsing a key = value pair, the whitespace around "=" is stripped, but a value's trailing whitespace is kept.  If a
#    value begins with whitespace, use backslash to escape that.  For more info see the java.util.Properties.load javadoc.
#    Best practice in jsettlers is to not use leading or trailing whitespace unless unavoidable, and always comment the
#    reason in the java code and above the properties key-value pair.
# - Backslashes must be doubled.  Tab, newline and carriage return are encoded as in Java strings (backslash-t, backslash-n, etc)
# - Don't use key:value format or continuation lines (ending with backslash), although java properties files allow them,
#    in order to simplify assumptions when parsing.
# - The encoding must be ISO-8859-1, not UTF-8; see the java.util.Properties javadoc for details.
#
# Reminders about the format used for text with arguments by SOCStringManager.get and MessageFormat.format:
# - When a string has arguments:
#     - Argument numbers start at 0: It''s {0}''s turn to roll the dice.
#     - Arguments can have a format type: {0} rolled a {1,number}.  See java.text.MessageFormat javadoc.
#     - Single-quote characters must be doubled: ''
#     - Left curly brackets must be single-quoted: '{'
#     - JSettlers has special types parsed by SOCStringManager.getSpecial, see its javadoc: {0,list}, {0,rsrcs}, etc
# - If the string has no arguments and won't go through MessageFormat.format,
#   shouldn't quote { brackets or double single-quotes.

gameopt.PL = Maximum # players
gameopt.PLB = Use 6-player board
gameopt.PLP = 6-player board: Can Special Build only if 5 or 6 players in game
gameopt.PLAY_FO = Show all player info and resources
gameopt.PLAY_VPO = Show all VP/dev card info
gameopt.SBL = Use sea board
gameopt.RD = Robber can't return to the desert

#    key game.options.scenario.optprefix should have this prefix as its value.
#    See also gamescen.*
gameopt._SC_SANY = Scenarios: SVP for your first settlement on any island after initial placement
gameopt._SC_SEAC = Scenarios: 2 SVP for your first settlement on each island after initial placement
gameopt._SC_FOG = Scenarios: Some hexes initially hidden by fog

gamescen.SC_4ISL.n = The Four Islands
gamescen.SC_4ISL.d = Start on one or two islands. Explore and gain SVP by building to others.
gamescen.SC_CLVI.n = Cloth Trade with neutral villages
gamescen.SC_CLVI.d = The small islands' villages give you Cloth; every 2 cloth you have is 1 extra Victory Point. To gain cloth, build ships to a village. You can't move the pirate until you've reached a village. Each player to reach a village gets 1 of its cloth at that time, and 1 more whenever its number is rolled, until the village runs out. Pirate can steal cloth or resources. If fewer than 4 villages still have cloth, the game ends and the player with the most VP wins. (If tied, player with most cloth wins.)
gamescen.SC_FOG.n = Fog Islands
gamescen.SC_FOG.d = Some hexes are initially hidden by fog. When you build a ship or road to a foggy hex, that hex is revealed. Unless it's water, you are given its resource as a reward.
gamescen.SC_FTRI.n = The Forgotten Tribe
gamescen.SC_FTRI.d = Far areas of the board have small habitations of a "forgotten tribe" of settlers. When players build ships to reach them, they are greeted with "gifts" of a development card, Special Victory Point, or a Port given to the player which must be moved adjacent to one of their coastal settlements/cities if possible, or set aside to place later.
gamescen.SC_NSHO.n = New Shores
gamescen.SC_PIRI.n = Pirate Islands and Fortresses
gamescen.SC_PIRI.d = A pirate fleet patrols, attacking to steal resources from weak players with adjacent settlements/cities until the player builds a strong fleet of Warships. Build ships directly to the Fortress of your color, which the pirates have captured from you. To win the game, you must reach the victory point goal and defeat the Fortress 3 times using warships. Ship routes can't branch out, only follow dotted lines to the Fortress. Strengthen your fleet by playing Warship development cards to upgrade your ships. When the pirate fleet attacks, you win if you have more Warships than the pirate fleet strength (randomly 1-6). No robber or largest army. When 7 is rolled, any pirate fleet attack happens before the usual discards.
gamescen.SC_TTD.n = Through The Desert
gamescen.SC_TTD.d = Start on the main island. Explore and gain SVP by building to the small islands, or through the desert to the coast.
gamescen.SC_WOND.n = Wonders
gamescen.SC_WOND.d = Each player chooses a unique Wonder and can build all 4 of its levels. Each Wonder has its own requirements before you may start it, such as several cities built or a port at a certain location. To win you must complete your Wonder's 4 levels, or reach 10 VP and complete more levels than any other player. Has no pirate ship.
