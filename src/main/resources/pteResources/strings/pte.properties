# To run the PTE editor with a locale different from the OS, use this jvm parameter: -Dpte.locale=es_MX
#
# Reminders about .properties filenames and format:
# - For a locale, the filename is bundlename_lang.properties or (more specific) bundlename_lang_COUNTRY.properties,
#    where lang and country are 2 or 3 characters each.  Keys not found there must be in bundlename.properties.
# - Logically related keys are grouped together in the files, with blank lines separating the groups.
#    Keys within a group might be alphabetical or chronological (based on editor workflow).  The groups are ordered
#    in the file with common groups first, then mostly chronologically, then rarely used groups near the end of the file.  
# - Key names are case-sensitive; this program uses lowercase alphanumeric keys, and "." to organize keys into hierarchies.
# - Keys which should not be localized must contain _nolocaliz
# - Parsing a key = value pair, the whitespace around "=" is stripped, but a value's trailing whitespace is kept.  If a
#    value begins with whitespace, use backslash to escape that.  For more info see the java.util.Properties.load javadoc.
#    Best practice here is to not use leading or trailing whitespace unless unavoidable, and always comment the
#    reason in the java code and above the properties key-value pair.
# - Backslashes must be doubled.  Tab, newline and carriage return are encoded as in Java strings (backslash-t, backslash-n, etc)
# - Don't use key:value format or continuation lines (ending with backslash), although java properties files allow them,
#    in order to simplify assumptions when parsing.
# - The encoding must be ISO-8859-1, not UTF-8; see the java.util.Properties javadoc for details.
#
# Reminders about the format used for text with arguments by StringManager.get and MessageFormat.format:
# - When a string has arguments:
#     - Argument numbers start at 0: Couldn''t find file on disk to match {0}.
#     - Arguments can have a format type: Found {0,number} matches.  See java.text.MessageFormat javadoc.
#     - Single-quote characters must be doubled: ''
#     - Left curly brackets must be single-quoted: '{'
# - If the string has no arguments and won't go through MessageFormat.format,
#   shouldn't quote { brackets or double single-quotes.
