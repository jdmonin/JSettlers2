/**
 * The single Inbound Message Queue for all messages coming from clients.
 * Stores all unparsed inbound {@link SOCMessage}s received from the server from all
 * connected clients' {@link Connection} threads through {@link #push(SOCMessage, Connection)},
 * then dispatched to the {@link Server} for parsing and processing.
 *<P>
 * That dispatch is done through this class's single internal {@link Treater} thread, which de-queues
 * the received messages from the queue and forwards them to the {@link Server} by calling
 * {@link Server.InboundMessageDispatcher#dispatch(SOCMessage, Connection)}
 * for each inbound message.
 *<P>
 * Some dispatched message handlers may want to do work in other Threads without tying up the Treater thread,
 * but then finish handling that message in the Treater to simplify locking of other objects.
 * For this, call {@link #post(Runnable)}: Same concept as {@link java.awt.EventQueue#invokeLater(Runnable)}.
 *
 *<H3>Startup:</H3>
 * This queue's constructor only sets up the InboundMessageQueue to receive messages. Afterwards when the
 * {@link Server} is ready to process inbound messages, you must call {@link #startMessageProcessing()}
 * to start this queue's thread to forward messages into the dispatcher.
 *
 *<H3>Shutdown:</H3>
 * At server shutdown time, {@code InboundMessageQueue} can be stopped by calling {@link #stopMessageProcessing()}
 * which will stop its {@link Treater} thread.
 *
 *<H3>More Information:</H3>
 *<UL>
 * <LI> See {@link Server} class javadoc for an overall picture of inbound processing.
 * <LI> See {@link SOCMessage} for details of the client/server protocol messaging.
 * <LI> See {@link Connection} for details of the client/server communication.
 * <LI> See {@link Server.InboundMessageDispatcher#dispatch(SOCMessage, Connection)}
 *      for details on further message processing.
