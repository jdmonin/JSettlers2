/**
 * Symmetric buffered connection sending strings between two local peers.
 * Uses vectors and thread synchronization, no actual network traffic.
 * When using this class from the server (not client), after the constructor
 * call {@link #setServer(Server)}.
 *<P>
 * This class has a run method, but you must start the thread yourself.
 * Constructors will not create or start a thread.
 *<P>
 * As used within JSettlers, the structure of this class has much in common
 * with {@link NetConnection}, as they both subclass {@link Connection}.
 * If you add something to one class you should probably add it to the other,
 * or to the superclass instead.
 *
 *<PRE>
 *  1.0.0 - 2007-11-18 - initial release, becoming part of jsettlers v1.1.00
 *  1.0.1 - 2008-06-28 - add getConnectTime
 *  1.0.2 - 2008-07-30 - check if s already null in disconnect
 *  1.0.3 - 2008-08-08 - add disconnectSoft, getVersion, setVersion (jsettlers 1.1.00 release)
 *  1.0.4 - 2008-09-04 - add appData
 *  1.0.5 - 2009-05-31 - add isVersionKnown, setVersion(int,bool), setVersionTracking,
 *                       isInputAvailable, callback to processFirstCommand,
 *                       wantsHideTimeoutMessage, setHideTimeoutMessage;
 *                       common constructor code moved to init().
 *  1.0.5.1- 2009-10-26- javadoc warnings fixed
 *  1.0.5.2- 2010-04-05- add toString for debugging
 *  1.2.0 - 2017-06-03 - {@link #setData(String)} now takes a String, not Object.
 *  2.0.0 - 2017-11-01 - Rename StringConnection -> Connection, NetStringConnection -> NetConnection,
 *                       LocalStringConnection -> StringConnection.
 *                       Connection is now a superclass, not an interface.
 *  2.1.0 - 2020-01-09 - Only server-side changes: See {@link SOCServerSocket}
 *  2.3.0 - 2020-04-27 - no change in this file
 *  2.5.0 - 2021-12-30 - put: fix cosmetic "IllegalStateException: Not accepted by server yet" seen when
 *                       sending message during disconnect/server shutdown
