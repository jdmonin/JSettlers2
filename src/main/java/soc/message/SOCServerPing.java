/**
 * This is a ping message from the server, or its reply from the client.
 *<P>
 * In version 1.1.08 and higher, the client echoes
 * the ping back to the server.  Server can use
 * this to ensure the client is still connected.
 * If another client attempts to connect with the same name,
 * same host (IP address), the first client will be pinged.
 * If the client does not respond within a minute or so,
 * it is replaced in all games by the newly connecting client.
 * Server attempts to send a final SERVERPING to the old client,
 * with sleepTime -1, to let it know it's no longer connected.
 *<P>
 * The server sends bot clients {@code SOCServerPing} about once every 2 minutes,
 * and those clients also locally generate and send themselves
 * one {@link SOCTimingPing} per second in their active games.
