/**
 * Server's report of the total amount rolled on the dice this turn,
 * or -1 at start of game or to clear displayed result during play.
 * The two individual dice amounts can be reported in a text message.
 *<P>
 * This is in response to a client player's {@link SOCRollDice} request.
 * Will sometimes be followed with various messages to entire game and/or
 * to some players, depending on the roll results and scenario/rules in effect.
 * The last data message of sequence sent to entire game is always {@link SOCGameState}
 * (rolling a 7 might lead to discards or moving the robber, etc.)
 *<P>
 * The guideline is that the "public" sequence ends with the new game state message,
 * then any new state text for human clients, then any prompt for action
 * sent to individual player clients in the new state.
 * Any special resource (cloth) distributed as roll results, or any report of action happening
 * (fleet battle lost/won), is sent before the state message.
 *
 *<H4>Sequence details</H4>
 *
 * When players gain resources on the roll, game members will be sent
 * {@link SOCDiceResultResources} if v2.0.00 or newer; older clients will
 * be sent {@link SOCPlayerElement SOCPlayerElement(GAIN, resType, amount)}
 * and a text message such as "Joe gets 3 sheep. Mike gets 1 clay."
 *<P>
 * Each player who gained resources on the roll (any client version) is sent their currently
 * held amounts for each resource as <tt>{@link SOCPlayerElements}(pn, {@link SOCPlayerElement#SET SET}, ...)</tt>
 * or a group of <tt>{@link SOCPlayerElement}(pn, SET, ...)</tt> messages.
 * When client receives such a 5-element {@code SOCPlayerElements} in state {@link SOCGame#ROLL_OR_CARD},
 * they may want to clear their {@link SOCResourceConstants#UNKNOWN} amount to 0 in case it has drifted.
 *<P>
 * Before v2.0.00 those were sent as a {@link SOCPlayerElement} group
 * to each player in the game after a roll, not just those who gained resources, followed by
 * sending the game a {@link SOCResourceCount} with their new total resource count.
 *<P>
 * When 7 is rolled and players must discard, then instead, {@code SOCDiceResult}
 * is followed by a {@link SOCGameState}({@link SOCGame#WAITING_FOR_DISCARDS}) announcement,
 * then a {@link SOCDiscardRequest} prompt to each affected player.
 * See {@link SOCDiscard} for player response and the next part of that sequence.
 *
 *<H4>End of sequence</H4>
 *
 * As noted above, the message sequence to the entire game always ends with {@code SOCGameState}.
 * That might be followed with {@link SOCGameServerText} for human players to read,
 * and/or messages sent privately to a player such as {@link SOCDiscardRequest}
 * (which doesn't need to be "public" because entire game knew the number of cards held
 * when the 7 was rolled).
