/**
 * This message from server to client signals start of a new player's turn.
 * Client should end current turn, set current player number and game state,
 * then clear dice, reset votes, etc by calling {@link SOCGame#updateAtTurn()}.
 *<P>
 * In v2.5.00 and newer ({@link #VERSION_FOR_FLAG_CLEAR_AND_SBP_TEXT}), when client receives this message
 * {@link SOCGame#updateAtTurn()} will clear the new player's {@link SOCPlayer#hasPlayedDevCard()} flag.
 * (Previous server versions sent {@link SOCSetPlayedDevCard} or
 * {@link SOCPlayerElement}({@link SOCPlayerElement.PEType#PLAYED_DEV_CARD_FLAG PLAYED_DEV_CARD_FLAG})
 * before {@code SOCTurn}. Server v2.5.00 and newer still send that playerelement message
 * to clients older than 2.5.00.)
 *<P>
 * Also in v2.5.00 and newer, during Special Building (SBP) server doesn't follow this message
 * with {@link SOCGameServerText}("Special building phase: Lily's turn to place"); client should print
 * a prompt like that when it receives {@code SOCTurn}({@link SOCGame#SPECIAL_BUILDING}).
 *<P>
 * Also in v2.5.00 and newer ({@link #VERSION_FOR_SEND_BEGIN_FIRST_TURN}),
 * is also sent to game during initial placement when a round ends,
 * since the direction of play changes, and player has just placed a road or ship and should now place
 * the next settlement or roll the dice to start the game's first turn of regular play.
 * (In v2.0.00 - 2.4.00, that SOCTurn was sent only when a robot was current player.
 * v1.x versions didn't send this message during init placement; there were fewer possible state transitions,
 * and the client's SOCGame had enough info to advance the gamestate and player number.)
 *<P>
 * In v2.0.00 and newer, this message optionally includes a {@link #getGameState()} field instead of
 * a separate {@link SOCGameState} message, since the state and turn are part of the same transition.
 *<P>
 * Before v2.0.00 this message was always preceded by a {@link SOCGameState} with the new turn's state.
 * There were a few minor messages like {@link SOCSetPlayedDevCard} sent between them.  Client would
 * set current game state based on that GAMESTATE message.  Then, when this TURN message changed the
 * player number, the game would have a known state to inform the new player's options and actions.
 *<P>
 * Before v2.0.00 the server didn't send a TURN message to human players after the final road or ship is placed
 * at the end of initial placement and start of regular gameplay, only a {@link SOCGameState}
 * message (state START2B -> PLAY/ROLL_OR_CARD).
 *<P>
 * In v1.1.20 and 1.2.00 only, at start of game this {@code SOCTurn} was followed by a {@link SOCGameState}.
