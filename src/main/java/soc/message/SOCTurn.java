/**
 * This message from server to client signals end of the current player's turn.
 * Client should end current turn, clear dice, set current player number, reset votes, etc.
 *<P>
 * In v2.0.00 and newer, this message optionally includes a {@link #getGameState()} field instead of
 * a separate {@link SOCGameState} message, since the state and turn are part of the same transition.
 *<P>
 * Before v2.0.00 this message was always preceded by a {@link SOCGameState} with the new turn's state.
 * There were a few minor messages like {@link SOCSetPlayedDevCard} sent between them.  Client would
 * set current game state based on that GAMESTATE message.  Then, when this TURN message changed the
 * player number, the game would have a known state to inform the new player's options and actions.
 *<P>
 * In v2.0.00 and newer, is also sent to robot players during initial placement when a round ends
 * and the direction of play changes, and bot has just placed a road or ship and should now place
 * the next settlement or roll the dice as first player. (In earlier versions with fewer possible
 * state transitions, the client's SOCGame had enough info to advance the gamestate and player
 * number.)
 *<P>
 * Before v2.0.00 the server didn't send a TURN message to human players after the final road or ship is placed
 * at the end of initial placement and start of regular gameplay, only a {@link SOCGameState}
 * message (state START2 -> PLAY/ROLL_OR_CARD).
