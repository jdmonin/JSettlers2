 * <LI> Client message to server is in response to a {@link SOCMakeOffer} announced earlier this turn

 * <LI> Server's response (announced to game) is {@link SOCPlayerElement}s, {@link SOCGameServerText},
 *      {@code AcceptOffer}, then {@link SOCClearOffer}s.

 *<P>
 * Before v2.0.00 the server announced the {@code SOCClearOffer}s before {@code SOCAcceptOffer}. The old
 * non-robot clients ignored that {@code SOCAcceptOffer}, so changing the order has no effect on them.
 *<P>
 * The server disallows any unacceptable trade by sending the client a
 * {@code SOCAcceptOffer} with reason code {@link SOCBankTrade#PN_REPLY_CANNOT_MAKE_TRADE}
 * in the {@link #getAcceptingNumber()} field.
 * Servers before v2.4.50 ({@link SOCBankTrade#VERSION_FOR_REPLY_REASONS}) disallowed by
 * sending an explanatory {@link SOCGameServerText}.
