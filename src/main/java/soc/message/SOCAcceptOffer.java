/**
 * This message means that the player is accepting an offer.

 * Sent from accepting player's client to server.
 * If the trade is allowed, announced from server to all players.
 *<UL>
 * <LI> Client message to server is in response to a {@link SOCMakeOffer} announced earlier this turn
 *      with client as an offered-to player.
 * <LI> Server's response (announced to game) is {@link SOCPlayerElement}s to clients older than v2.5,
 *      then {@code SOCAcceptOffer}, {@link SOCGameTextMsg} to v1.x clients, then {@link SOCClearOffer}s.
 *</UL>
 *<P>
 * The server disallows any unacceptable trade by sending that "accepting" client a
 * {@code SOCRejectOffer} with reason code {@link SOCRejectOffer#REASON_CANNOT_MAKE_TRADE}.
 * Servers before v2.5.00 ({@link SOCRejectOffer#VERSION_FOR_REPLY_REASONS})
 * sent an explanatory {@link SOCGameServerText} instead.
 *<P>
 * In v2.5 and newer ({@link #VERSION_FOR_OMIT_PLAYERELEMENTS}),
 * the server's {@code SOCAcceptOffer} contains the resources being traded.
 *<P>
 * Only v1.x clients are sent the {@code SOCGameTextMsg}, which conveys the same info as this {@code SOCAcceptOffer}.
 * Before v2.5.00 the server announced {@code SOCGameTextMsg} before {@code SOCAcceptOffer}, instead of after.
 *<P>
 * Before v2.0.00 the server announced the {@code SOCClearOffer}s before {@code SOCAcceptOffer}. The old
 * non-robot clients ignored that {@code SOCAcceptOffer}, so changing the order has no effect on them.
