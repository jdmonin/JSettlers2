/**
 * This message says which resources the player picked for a
 * Discovery/Year of Plenty card, or (v2.0.00+) free resources from the Gold Hex
 * or other events in Sea Board scenarios.
 *<P>
 * Also used in scenario SC_PIRI when player wins a free resource for defeating the
 * pirate fleet attack at a dice roll, as if it's a gold hex free resource.
 *
 *<H3>Sent from Client:</H3>
 *
 * For <B>Discovery/Year of Plenty,</B> this is the client response to server's
 * {@link SOCGameState GAMESTATE}({@link SOCGame#WAITING_FOR_DISCOVERY WAITING_FOR_DISCOVERY}).
 *<P>
 * For <B>Gold Hex</B> picks or other Sea Board scenarios, this is the Client response to server's
 * {@link SOCSimpleRequest}({@link SOCSimpleRequest#PROMPT_PICK_RESOURCES PROMPT_PICK_RESOURCES}).
 * (Same prompt/response pattern as {@link SOCDiscardRequest} / {@link SOCDiscard}.)
 *<P>
 * In either of those situations, if the resource count is wrong, the server will
 * resend {@code SOCSimpleRequest(PROMPT_PICK_RESOURCES)} with the required resource count.
 * (A v1 client will instead be sent {@code SOCGameState(WAITING_FOR_DISCOVERY)} again.)
 *<P>
 * Otherwise, server announces a {@code SOCPickResources} to the game to give player those resources:
 * See next section for details.
 *
 *<H3>Sent from Server:</H3>
 *
 * A player has chosen their two free Discovery/Year of Plenty resources
 * in state {@link soc.game.SOCGame#WAITING_FOR_DISCOVERY}, or free Gold Hex resources.
 * Announced by server to update game data and have the client indicate that the trade has happened,
 * as if they were sent a {@code SOCGameServerText} about it, based on {@link #getReasonCode()} value.
 * When reason code is 0, print no text: Server might follow this message with a {@link SOCGameServerText}
 * to explain the reason for this resource pick.
 *<P>
 * For gold hex picks, server follows this message with a
 * {@link SOCPlayerElement}({@link SOCPlayerElement.PEType#NUM_PICK_GOLD_HEX_RESOURCES NUM_PICK_GOLD_HEX_RESOURCES}, 0)
 * to clear that player field.
 *<P>
 * When server announces to clients older than v2.5.00 ({@link #VERSION_FOR_SERVER_ANNOUNCE}),
 * it instead sends player data update {@link SOCPlayerElement} message(s) and {@link SOCGameServerText}.
 *<P>
 * Before v2.0.00 this message class was called {@code SOCDiscoveryPick}.
