/**
 * This game data message from server reopens or closes a shipping trade route.
 * Typically this is sent (to reopen) near start of a sequence to undo placing or moving a ship ({@link SOCUndoPutPiece}).
 * Closing a ship route is handled at client's game logic while the pieces are placed,
 * not by sending a message from the server.
 *<P>
 * Because the open/closed flag is element 0 of the sent parameters, client should call
 * <tt>{@link SOCBoardLarge#setShipsClosed(boolean, int[], int) board.setShipsClosed}
 * ({@link #isClosed()}, {@link SOCMessageTemplateMi#getParams() getParams()}, 1)</tt>.
