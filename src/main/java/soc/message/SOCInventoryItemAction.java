/**
 * This message is a client player request, or server response or announcement,
 * about {@link SOCInventoryItem}s in a player's inventory.
 *<P>
 * Inventory items are held by a player like {@link soc.game.SOCDevCard SOCDevCard}s.
 * These special items are used by certain scenarios, and the meaning of
 * each one's {@link #itemType} is specific to the scenario.
 * An item's current state can be NEW and not yet playable; PLAYABLE now; or KEPT until end of game.
 *<P>
 * Possible message traffic, by {@link #action}:
 *<UL>
 *<LI> From Server to one client or all clients:
 * Add an item to a player's inventory with a certain state: {@link #ADD_PLAYABLE}, {@link #ADD_OTHER}
 *<LI> From Client: Player is requesting to {@link #PLAY} a playable item
 *<LI> If the client can't currently play that type,
 * server responds with {@link #CANNOT_PLAY}, optionally with a {@link #reasonCode}
 *<LI> When a player plays an item, server sends {@link #PLAYED} to all clients,
 * including all flags such as {@link #isKept} and {@link #canCancelPlay}.
 * Messages after that will indicate new game state or any other results of playing the item.
 *<LI> If some other game action or event causes an item to need placement on the board,
 * but it was never in the player's inventory, server sends {@link #PLACING_EXTRA}
 * to give the item details such as {@link #itemType} and {@link #canCancelPlay}.
 * Play/placement rules are specific to each kind of inventory action, and the {@code PLACING_EXTRA}
 * message may be sent before a game state change or other messages necessary for placement.
 * See {@link #PLACING_EXTRA}'s javadoc for client handling.
 *</UL>
 * When the server sends a {@code SOCInventoryItemAction}, it doesn't also send a {@link SOCGameServerText} explaining
 * the details; the client must print such text based on the {@code SOCInventoryItemAction} received.
 *<P>
 * Based on {@link SOCDevCardAction}.
 *<P>
 *
 * <H5>Usage for specific scenarios' special items:</H5>
 *<UL>
 * <LI> {@link SOCGameOptionSet#K_SC_FTRI _SC_FTRI}: Trade ports received as gifts. <BR>
 *   In state {@link SOCGame#PLAY1} or {@link SOCGame#SPECIAL_BUILDING}, current player sends this when they
 *   have a port in their inventory.  {@code itemType} is the negative of the port type to play.
 *  <P>
 *   If they can place now, server broadcasts SOCInventoryItemAction({@link #PLAYED}) to the game to remove
 *   it from player's inventory, then sends {@link SOCGameState}({@link SOCGame#PLACING_INV_ITEM PLACING_INV_ITEM}).
 *   (Player's client UI shouldn't let them place before the new game state is sent.)
 *   When the requesting client receives this PLAYED message, it will call {@link SOCGame#setPlacingItem(SOCInventoryItem)}
 *   because {@link SOCInventoryItem#isPlayForPlacement(SOCGame, int)} is true for {@code _SC_FTRI}.
 *  <P>
 *   Otherwise, server responds with {@link #CANNOT_PLAY} with one of these {@link #reasonCode}s: <BR>
 *   1 if the requested port type isn't in the player's inventory <BR>
 *   2 if the game options don't permit moving trade ports <BR>
 *   3 if the game state or current player aren't right to request placement now <BR>
 *   4 if player's {@link soc.game.SOCPlayer#getPortMovePotentialLocations(boolean)} is null <BR>
 *  <P>
 *   The port may be placed immediately if the player puts a ship at its original location and has
 *   a coastal settlement with room for a port.  Such a port will never be in the player's inventory.
 *   The server will immediately send that player {@link #PLACING_EXTRA} with the port's details;
 *   see that action's javadoc for client handling of the message.
 *  <P>
 *   When the player chooses their placement location, they should send
 *   {@link SOCSimpleRequest}({@link SOCSimpleRequest#TRADE_PORT_PLACE TRADE_PORT_PLACE}).
 *   See that constant's javadoc for details.
 *</UL>
