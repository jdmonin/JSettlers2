/**
 * From client, this message gives the resources that a player has chosen to discard;
 * client's response to server's {@link SOCDiscardRequest}.
 *<P>
 * If the resource total isn't correct, server v2.5.00 and newer will
 * resend {@code SOCDiscardRequest} with the required resource count.
 *<P>
 * If this is the right total amount to discard, server will respond to player
 * with {@code SOCDiscard} to confirm the details, and report only the total amount discarded
 * to the other players via {@code SOCDiscard}(UNKNOWN=total).
 * Clients older than v2.5 ({@link #VERSION_FOR_OMIT_PLAYERELEMENTS_ALWAYS_GAMESTATE})
 * are instead sent {@link SOCPlayerElement} or {@link SOCPlayerElements}(LOSE) messages and text.
 *<P>
 * Server will then send the new {@link SOCGameState}.
 * If waiting for others to discard, server then sends the game a {@link SOCGameServerText} that lists
 * who we're still waiting for. The {@link SOCGameState}({@link SOCGame#WAITING_FOR_DISCARDS WAITING_FOR_DISCARDS})
 * sent is redundant in that case, but server sends it anyway in order to regularize the message sequence
 * to make it easier for bots to understand.
 *<P>
 * Server v2.0.00 through v2.4.00 didn't send that {@code SOCGameState(WAITING_FOR_DISCARDS)},
 * to be a bit more efficient. So for compatibility, server won't send that redundant message to
 * clients older than v2.5. All client versions including v1.x.xx correctly display progress of the discards
 * without needing that {@code SOCGameState}.
