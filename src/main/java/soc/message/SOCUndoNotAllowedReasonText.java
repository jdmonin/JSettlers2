/**
 * Message from server to game's clients, to let them know that the
 * current player's most recent action can't be undone because of an uncommon situation or scenario.
 * Example: in the {@link SOCScenario#K_SC_FTRI SC_FTRI} scenario the player can
 * build or move ships to certain locations to receive dev cards or a "gift port" for trading, but
 * we currently disallow undoing the action if it gave a "gift port" because that's difficult to undo
 * and there was a confirmation dialog before the action.

 *<H4>I18N:</H4>
 * Like any {@link SOCKeyedMessage} type, server code uses a string key when
 * constructing this message, then the server's net code localizes that key
 * when sending to each client. This allows new reason explanations without client changes.
