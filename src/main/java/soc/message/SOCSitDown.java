/**
 * This message from client means that a player wants to sit down to play;
 * from server it announces a client has sat down to play.
 * When client is joining a game, server sends a {@code SOCSitDown} for each already-seated player
 * to give their names and robot flags before sending {@link SOCBoardLayout} or {@link SOCBoardLayout2}.
 *<P>
 * When client and server are v2.3.00 or newer ({@link SOCDevCardAction#VERSION_FOR_SITDOWN_CLEARS_INVENTORY}),
 * when client is sitting down to play and receives this message for their own player,
 * they should clear their inventory contents: See that constant's javadoc for details.
 *<P>
 * If human clients are joining a game which was reloaded from a saved snapshot
 * (game state {@link soc.game.SOCGame#LOADING}), the game might have unclaimed non-vacant seats
 * which were a human player when game was saved, but no client is currently connected to.
 * SOCSitDown for those seats is sent with {@link #isRobot()} true so the client will show
 * a "Take Over" button for them.
 *<P>
 * Server v2.5.00 and newer ignores {@link #isRobot()} flag from client,
 * because robot clients authenticate before joining games.
 *<P>
 * Although it's a game-specific message, this game-lifecycle message
 * is handled by {@code SOCServer} instead of a {@code GameHandler}.
