/**
 * Typically this message means that the player is rejecting all offers ("no thanks").
 * Server can also send it with a "reason code" when rejecting a client's trade-related request
 * (player trade or bank trade).
 *
 *<H3>Typical usage: (without a reason code)</H3>
 *
 * Sent from rejecting player's client to server.
 * The server then announces the rejection to all players.
 *<UL>
 * <LI> Message to server is client player's response to a {@link SOCMakeOffer} sent earlier this turn.
 * <LI> Followed by (from server, to all clients) {@link SOCRejectOffer} with the same data.
 *</UL>
 *
 *<H3>With a reason code:</H3>
 *
 * Sent from server to a player's client in response to their bank trade, player trade offer,
 * or request to accept a trade, with the specific reason it was disallowed ({@link #REASON_NOT_YOUR_TURN},
 * {@link #REASON_CANNOT_MAKE_OFFER}, or generic {@link #REASON_CANNOT_MAKE_TRADE}).
 * See those constants for info about when they're used,
 * or {@link #getReasonCode()} for general info.
 *<P>
 * In a future version or fork, reason codes could also be sent from a rejecting player's client
 * to give a specific reason for the rejection. This would be mentioned in that reason code constant's
 * javadoc. Server would then announce the rejection to all players.
 *<P>
 * Reason code field is ignored by clients older than v2.5.00 ({@link #VERSION_FOR_REPLY_REASONS}).
 * Older clients are sent {@link SOCGameServerText} instead.
