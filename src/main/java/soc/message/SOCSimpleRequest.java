/**
 * This generic message handles a simple request from a client player in a game,
 * or a prompt from the server to a client player who needs to make a decision or take action.
 * This is a way to add game actions without adding new SOCMessage subclasses.
 * It has a player number, a request type code, and two optional detail-value fields.
 * The type code constants' javadocs detail usage of that type code.
 * Request types which are prompts from the server are declared with prefix {@code PROMPT_}.
 *<P>
 * To get the optional detail value fields from a {@code SOCSimpleRequest}, be sure to use {@link #getValue1()}
 * and {@link #getValue2()}, not {@link #getParam1()} and {@link #getParam2()} which would instead return the
 * player number and request type code.  {@link #getPlayerNumber()} and {@link #getRequestType()} are
 * convenience methods with more intuitive names to retrieve the player number and typecode.
 *<P>
 * This message type would be useful for new functions that don't have a complicated
 * set of details attached.  If {@link SOCRollDicePrompt} or the Ask-Special-Build message types
 * were implemented today, they would add request types to this message type.
 *
 *<H3>Request from Client to Server</H3>
 *<UL>
 * <LI> Client sends to server: (pn, typecode, value1, value2). Unless the request type code's javadoc says otherwise,
 *      {@code pn} must be their own player number so that the server could announce the request using the same message
 *      type and parameters instead of defining another type.
 * <LI> If client can't do this request now, server responds to client only with: (pn = -1, typecode, value1b, value2b).
 *      The meaning of the response's optional {@code value1b} and {@code value2b} are typecode-specific and
 *      might not be the same as {@code value1} or {@code value2}.
 *      If the server is too old to understand this request type, it will respond with (pn = -1, typecode, 0, 0).
 * <LI> If client is permitted to do the request, server's response depends on the request type:
 *      Announce the client's request to all players in game,
 *      or take some game action and announce the results using other message types.
 *</UL>
 *
 *<H3>Prompt from Server to Client</H3>
 *<UL>
 * <LI> Server sends to client: (pn, typecode, value, value2). Some request type codes may send
 *      to all players in the game. Their javadocs will say so; otherwise, assume only a single client player
 *      receives the prompt message. If a client player receives such a "broadcast" {@code SOCSimpleRequest}
 *      having {@code pn} != their player number, no action is needed and the message is only to tell the game
 *      why everyone is waiting on {@code pn}.
 * <LI> Unless client is a bot, client UI indicates to the user they need to make a decision or take action
 * <LI> User makes their decision, responds to prompt seen in UI
 * <LI> Client sends to server the appropriate message(s) specified in {@code typecode} constant's javadoc
 *</UL>
 *
 *<H3>Request Type Code Number Ranges</H3>
 * Request type codes below 1000 are for general types that different kinds of games might be able to use. <BR>
 * Gametype-specific request types start at 1000.
