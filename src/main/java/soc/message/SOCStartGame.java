/**
 * From client, this message is a player's request to start the game;
 * from server, it means a game has just started, leaving state {@code NEW}.
 * First player number will be announced soon with a {@link SOCTurn}.
 *<P>
 * Server v1.x sends the game's new {@link SOCGameState} before sending {@code SOCStartGame}.
 * Although it receives both messages, client should be sure to call start-of-game methods only once.
 * In v2.0.00 and newer, this message optionally includes a {@link #getGameState()} field
 * instead of a separate {@link SOCGameState} message, since the state is part of the Start Game transition.
 *<P>
 * If a client joins a game in progress, it won't be sent a {@code SOCStartGame} message,
 * only the game's current {@code SOCGameState} and other parts of the game's and
 * players' current status: See {@link SOCJoinGameAuth}.
