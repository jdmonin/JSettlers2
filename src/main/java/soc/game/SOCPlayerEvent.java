 * Per-player event codes sent to {@link SOCGameEventListener}s.
 * Each event also has a {@link SOCGameOption} to indicate its scenario rules are active; see enum value javadocs.
 *<P>
 * Not all scenario-related rules changes have or need an event. For example, in
 * {@link SOCGameOptionSet#K_SC_PIRI _SC_PIRI} the Knight/Soldier card is used only to
 * convert ships to warships.  This happens every time the card is played, so there's
 * no event for it.  The game/server logic for playing dev cards checks for {@code _SC_PIRI}
 * right there, instead of code elsewhere in an event listener.  However, in
 * {@link SOCGameOptionSet#K_SC_SANY _SC_SANY} the player will <em>sometimes</em> get an
 * SVP for settling a new island; it doesn't happen each time the player builds a settlement.
 * So, a scenario event communicates the new SVP there.
