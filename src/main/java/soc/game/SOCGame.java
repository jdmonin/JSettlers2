/**
 * A class for holding and manipulating game data.
 * Most methods are not implicitly thread-safe;
 * call {@link #takeMonitor()} and {@link #releaseMonitor()} around them.
 *<P>
 * The model in this client/server game is: The SOCGame at server contains the game's
 * complete state information, and game logic advances there.
 * Each client's local SOCGame contains only partial state (for instance, other
 * players' resources or devel cards may be of unknown type); and the server directly
 * updates clients' game state by sending messages such as
 * {@link soc.message.SOCGameState} and {@link soc.message.SOCSetPlayedDevCard}.
 * Within this package, you can check {@link #isAtServer}.
 *<P>
 * Many methods assume you've already checked whether the move is valid,
 * and won't check it a second time.  For example, {@link #canPlayKnight(int)}
 * should be called to check before calling {@link #playKnight()}.
 *<P>
 * For the board <b>coordinate system and terms</b> (hex, node, edge), see the
 * {@link SOCBoard} class javadoc.
 *<P>
 * Games are created at the server in {@link soc.server.SOCGameListAtServer} and given an
 * expiration time 120 minutes away
 * ({@link soc.server.SOCGameListAtServer#GAME_TIME_EXPIRE_MINUTES SOCGameListAtServer.GAME_TIME_EXPIRE_MINUTES}).
 * Players then choose their seats, optionally locking empty seats against joining robots,
 * and any player can click the Start Game button.
 *<P>
 * Game play begins with the server calling {@link #startGame()}, then sending messages to clients
 * with the starting game state and player data and a board layout.
 * After initial placement, normal play begins with the first player's turn, in state {@link #ROLL_OR_CARD};
 * {@link #updateAtGameFirstTurn()} is called for any work needed.
 *<P>
 * During game play, {@link #putPiece(SOCPlayingPiece)} and other game-action methods update {@code gameState}.
 * {@link #updateAtTurn()}, <tt>putPiece</tt> and some other game-action methods update {@link #lastActionTime}.
 *<P>
 * The game's current plays and actions are tracked through game states, such as
 * {@value #START1A} or {@link #WAITING_FOR_DISCARDS}.  A normal turn starts at {@link #ROLL_OR_CARD};
 * after dice are rolled, the turn will spend most of its time in {@link #PLAY1}.  If you need to
 * add a state, please see the instructions at {@link #NEW}.
 *<P>
 * The winner is the player who has {@link #vp_winner} or more victory points (typically 10)
 * on their own turn.  Some optional game scenarios have special win conditions, see {@link #checkForWinner()}.
 *<P>
 * The {@link SOCGame#hasSeaBoard large sea board} features scenario events.
 * To listen for these, call {@link #setGameEventListener(SOCGameEventListener)}.
 * If the game has a scenario, its {@link SOCGameOption}s will include {@code "SC"}, possibly along with
 * other options whose key names start with {@code "_SC_"}.
 *<P>
 * To persist a game's contents or save/load, use {@link soc.server.savegame.SavedGameModel}.

     *
     *<H3>Other things to note:</H3>
     * For some scenarios on the {@link SOCGame#hasSeaBoard large sea board}, placing
     * a settlement in a new Land Area may award the player a Special Victory Point (SVP).
     * This method will increment {@link SOCPlayer#getSpecialVP()}

     * Some scenarios use extra initial pieces in fixed locations, placed in
