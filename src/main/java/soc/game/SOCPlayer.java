/**
 * A class for holding and manipulating player data.
 * The player exists within one SOCGame, not persistent between games like SOCPlayerClient or SOCClientData.
 *<P>
 * At the start of each player's turn, {@link SOCGame#updateAtTurn()} will call {@link SOCPlayer#updateAtTurn()},
 * then call the current player's {@link #updateAtOurTurn()}.
 *<P>
 * The player's hand holds resource cards, unplayed building pieces, and an inventory of development cards
 * and sometimes scenario-specific items.
 *<P>
 * For more information about the "legal" and "potential" road/settlement/city terms,
 * see page 61 of Robert S Thomas' dissertation.  Briefly:
 * "Legal" locations are where pieces can be placed, according to the game rules.
 * "Potential" locations are where pieces can be placed <em>soon</em>, based on the
 * current state of the game board.  For example, every legal settlement location is
 * also a potential settlement during initial placement (game state {@link SOCGame#START1A START1A}
 * through {@link SOCGame#START3A START3A}.  Once the player's final initial settlement is placed,
 * all potential settlement locations are cleared.  Only when they build 2 connected road
 * segments, will another potential settlement location be set.
 *<P>
 * If the board layout changes from game to game, as with {@link SOCBoardLarge} /
 * {@link SOCBoardLarge#BOARD_ENCODING_LARGE}, use these methods to update the player's board data
 * after {@link SOCBoard#makeNewBoard(Map)}, in this order:
 *<UL>
 * <LI> {@link #getPlayerNumber()}.{@link SOCPlayerNumbers#setLandHexCoordinates(int[]) setLandHexCoordinates(int[])}
 * <LI> {@link #setPotentialAndLegalSettlements(Collection, boolean, HashSet[])}
 * <LI> Optionally, {@link #setRestrictedLegalShips(int[])}
 *</UL>
 *<P>
 * On the {@link SOCBoardLarge large sea board}, our list of the player's roads also
 * contains their ships.  They are otherwise treated separately.
 *<P>
 * Some fields are for use at the server only, and are null at the client:
 * {@link #resourceStats}, {@link #pendingMessagesOut}, etc.
 * To get a SOCPlayer client's {@code StringConnection}, use
 * {@code SOCServer.getConnection(player.{@link #getName()}).
