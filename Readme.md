# Java Settlers
A web-based client-server version of Settlers of Catan

## Introduction

JSettlers is a web-based version of the board game Settlers of Catan
written in Java. This client-server system supports multiple
simultaneous games between people and computer-controlled
opponents. Initially created as an AI research project.

The client may be run as a Java application, or as an applet when
accessed from a web site which also hosts a JSettlers server.

The server can optionally use a database to store player account
information and game stats (details below).  A client applet to
create user accounts is also provided.

If you're upgrading from an earlier version of JSettlers, check
VERSIONS.txt for new features, bug fixes, and config changes.

JSettlers is an open-source project licensed under the GPL. The
project is hosted at https://github.com/jdmonin/JSettlers2/ and
at http://nand.net/jsettlers/devel/ .  Questions, bugs, patches,
and pull requests can be posted at the github page.

## Documentation

User documentation for game play is available as .html pages located
in "docs/users" directory. These can be put on a JSettlers server for
its users using the applet.

Currently, this README is the only technical documentation for running
the client or server, setup and other issues. Over time, more docs
will be written. If you are interested in helping write documentation
please contact the development team from our github page.

## Requirements

To play JSettlers by connecting to a remote server you will need the
Java Runtime Version 5 or above. To connect as an applet, use any
browser which is Java enabled (using the browser plug-in) or just
download the JAR from http://nand.net/jsettlers/ and run it.

To Play JSettlers locally you need the Java Runtime 5 or above.
`JSettlers-full.jar` can connect directly to any server over the Internet.

To host a JSettlers server that provides a web applet for clients, you will
need an http server such as Apache's httpd, available from http://httpd.apache.org.

The JSettlers-full.jar file can also run locally as a server, without
needing a web server.  The applet is considered more convenient,
because you know everyone will have the same version.

To build JSettlers from source, you will need Java JDK 1.5 or newer and Apache Ant,
available from http://ant.apache.org, or an IDE such as Eclipse which understands
Ant's format. See README.developer for details.

## Server Setup and Testing

From the command line, make sure you are in the JSettlers distribution
directory which contains both `JSettlers.jar`, `JsettlersServer.jar` and the
`lib` directory.  (If you have downloaded `jsettlers-2.x.xx-full.tar.gz`,
look in the src/target directory for these files.)

If you have downloaded `jsettlers-2.x.xx-full.jar` or `jsettlers-2.x.xx-server.jar`
instead of the full tar.gz, use that filename on the command lines shown below.

### Startup

Start the server with the following command
(server requires Java 5 or higher, or JDK 1.5 or higher):

    java -jar JSettlersServer.jar

This will start the server on the default port of `8880` with `7` robots.
It will try to connect to an optional mysql database named `socdata`;
startup will continue even if the db connect doesn't work.

You can change those values and specify game option defaults; see details below.

If MySQL or another database is not installed and running (See "Database Setup"),
you will see a warning with the appropriate explanation:

    Warning: No user database available: ....
    Users will not be authenticated.

The database is not required: Without it, the server will function normally
except that user accounts cannot be maintained.

If you do use the database, you can give users a nickname and password to use
when they log in and play.  People without accounts can still connect, by
leaving the password field blank, as long as they aren't using a nickname
which has a password in the database.  Optionally game results can also be
stored in the database, see next section; results are not stored by default.

Parameters and game option defaults:

JSettlers options, parameters, and game option defaults can be specified on the
command line, or in a `jsserver.properties` file in the current directory when
you start the server.

Command line example:

    java -jar JSettlersServer.jar -Djsettlers.startrobots=9 8880 50

In this example the parameters are: Start 9 bots; TCP port number 8880;
max clients 50.

The started robots count against your max simultaneous connections (50 in this
example).  If the robots leave less than 6 player connections available, or if
they take more than half the max connections, a warning message is printed at
startup. To start a server with no robots (human players only), use

    -Djsettlers.startrobots=0

Any command-line switches and options go before the port number if specified
on the command line.  If the command includes -jar, switches and options go
after the jar filename.

To change a Game Option from its default, for example to activate the house rule
"Robber can't return to the desert", use the `-o` switch with the game option's
name and value, or equivalently "-Djsettlers.gameopt." + the name and value:

    -o RD=t
    -Djsettlers.gameopt.RD=t

You could also set a default game scenario this way; for example if your server
was running a tournament of Fog Islands games:

    -o SC=SC_FOG

If the scenario's game options conflict with any other game options given (VP,
etc), a warning will be printed during startup.  In general, servers shouldn't
set a default scenario; users can choose a scenario on their own if they want.

To have all completed games' results stored in the database, use this option:

    -Djsettlers.db.save.games=Y

To see a list of all jsettlers options (use them with -D), run:

    java -jar JSettlersServer.jar --help

This will print all server options, and all Game Option default values. Note the
format of those default values: Some options need both a true/false flag and a
numeric value. To change the default winning victory points to 12 for example:

    -o VP=t12

    jsserver.properties:

Instead of a long command line, any option can be added to `jsserver.properties`
which is read at startup if it exists in the current directory.  Any option
given on the command line overrides the same option in the properties file.
Comment lines start with # .  See src/bin/jsserver.properties.sample for full
descriptions of all available properties.

This example command line
  java -jar JSettlersServer.jar -Djsettlers.startrobots=9 -o RD=t 8880 50 socuser socpass
is the same as jsserver.properties with these contents:

    jsettlers.startrobots=9
    jsettlers.gameopt.RD=t
    jsettlers.port=8880
    jsettlers.connections=50
    # db user and pass are optional
    jsettlers.db.user=socuser
    jsettlers.db.pass=socpass

To determine if the server is reading the properties file, look for this text
near the start of the console output:

    Reading startup properties from jsserver.properties

To check the syntax and values of a `jsserver.properties file`, use the `-t` or

    --test-config command line parameter for Config Validation Mode:
    java -jar JSettlersServer.jar --test-config

This will test and print all configured values and then exit with return code 0
if no problems are found, nonzero otherwise. Output will include a summary line
such as:

    * Config Validation Mode: No problems found.

### Connect a client

Now, double-click JSettlers.jar to launch the client.  If you'd
prefer to start the player client from another command line window,
use the following command:

    java -jar JSettlers.jar

Optionally you can also provide the server's name and port, to skip
the Connect To Server dialog:

    java -jar JSettlers.jar localhost 8880

When the client launches, click Connect To Server. Leave the Server
name field blank to connect to your own computer (localhost) and use
the JSettlers server you started up in the previous section.

Once you've connected, enter any name in the Nickname field and
create a new game.

Type `*STATS*` into the chat part of the game window.  You should see
something like the following in the chat display:

    * > Uptime: 0:0:26
    * > Total connections: 1
    * > Current connections: 1
    * > Total Users: 1
    * > Games started: 0
    * > Games finished: 0
    * > Total Memory: 2031616
    * > Free Memory: 1524112
    * > Version: 1100 (1.1.00) build JM20080808

Now click on the "Sit Here" button and press "Start Game".  The robot
players should automatically join the game and start playing.

To play again with the same game options and players, click "Quit", then "Reset Board".
If other people are in the game, they will be asked to vote on the reset; any player can
reject it. If bots are in your game, and you want to reset with fewer or no bots, click
the bot's Lock button before clicking Quit/Reset and it won't rejoin the reset game.

If you want other people to access your server, tell them your server address
and port number (the default is 8880).  They can run the JSettlers.jar file by
itself, and it will bring up a window to enter your server address (DNS name
or IP) and port number.  Or, they can enter the following command:

    java -jar JSettlers.jar <server_address> <port_number>

If you would like to maintain accounts for your JSettlers server,
start the database prior to starting the JSettlers Server. See the
directions in "Database Setup".

### Server shutdown

To shut down the server hit `Ctrl-C` in its console window, or connect as the
optional debug user and enter `*STOP*` in the chat area of a game window.
This will stop the server and all connected clients will be disconnected.
(See README.developer if you want to set up a debug user.)

### Install a JSettlers server

Checklist:

- Start MySQL or PostgreSQL server
  (this database is optional; if you want a db, file-based sqlite also works)
- Copy and edit `jsserver.properties` (optional)
- Start JSettlers Server
- Start http server (optional)
- Copy `JSettlers.jar` client JAR and `web/*.html` to an http-served directory (optional)

To maintain user accounts, be sure to start the database first. (If you
use a database, you can give some users accounts; everyone else can still
log in and play by leaving the password field blank.)
For details see the "Database Setup" section below.

To install a JSettlers server, start the server as described in "Server Setup
and Testing". Remember that you can set server parameters and game option
default values with a `jsserver.properties` file: Copy the sample file
`bin/jsserver.properties.sample` to the same directory as `JSettlersServer.jar`,
rename it to `jsserver.properties`, and edit properties as needed.

Remote users can simply start their clients as described there,
and connect to your server's DNS name or IP address.

To provide a web page from which users can run the applet, you will
need to set up an http server such as Apache.  We assume you have
installed it already, and will refer to `${docroot}` as a directory
to place files to be served by your web server.

Copy `index.html` from `src/web/` to `${docroot}`.  If you're going to use an
accounts database and anyone can register their own account (this is not
the default setting), also copy `accounts.html`.

Edit the html to make sure the PORT parameter in `index.html` and `account.html`
applet tags match the port of your JSettlers server, and the text starting
"this applet connects to" has the right server name and port for users who can't
run the applet in their browser.  If you're using `account.html`, also
un-comment `index.html`'s link to `account.html`.

Next copy the `JSettlers.jar` client file to `${docroot}`. This will allow users
to use the web browser plug-in or download it to connect from their computer.
If you've downloaded it as `JSettlers-{version}-full.jar`, rename it to `JSettlers.jar`.

Your web server directory structure should now contain:

    ${docroot}/index.html
    ${docroot}/account.html (optional)
    ${docroot}/JSettlers.jar

Users should now be able to visit your web site to run the JSettlers client.

### Upgrading from an earlier version

If you're doing a new installation, not upgrading a server that's
already been running JSettlers, skip this section.

It's a simple process to upgrade to the latest version of JSettlers:

- Read VERSIONS.txt for new features, bug fixes, and config changes
  made from your version to the latest version.  Occasionally defaults
  change and you'll need to add a server config option to keep the
  same behavior, so read carefully.
- If you're upgrading from JSettlers 1.1.18 or earlier, for security reasons
  newer versions by default disallow user account self-registration. If you
  still want to use that option, search this README for "open registration".
- Save a backup copy of your current JSettlers.jar and JSettlersServer.jar,
  in case you want to run the old version for any reason.
- If you're using the optional database for user accounts and game scores,
  make a backup or export its contents.  JSettlers 1.2.00 is the first version
  which has schema changes, which are recommended but optional (see below).
- Stop the old server
- Copy the new JSettlers.jar and JSettlersServer.jar into place
- Start the new server, including any new options you wanted from VERSIONS.txt
- If the new server's startup messages include this line:
	* Database schema upgrade is recommended: To upgrade, use `-Djsettlers.db.upgrade_schema=Y` command line flag.
  Then do so now if convenient. The schema upgrade is not required immediately,
  to give you more flexibility, but may be required for some new features.
  When you run JSettlersServer with that upgrade flag plus your usual parameters
  it will check necessary conditions; upgrade the database; report success or
  any problems found; then exit immediately. You should see:
	DB schema upgrade was successful. Exiting now.

  The schema version and upgrade history is kept in the db_version table. The
  upgrade_schema flag is not used during day-to-day operation of the server.

  Note: If you've been using jsettlers 1.1.20 or older, test bcrypt speed and
  set the work_factor property before starting the upgrade process. For details
  search for "Password Encryption (BCrypt)" in this file.

  Note: If you've been using jsettlers 1.1.20 or older with postgresql,
  the upgrade may tell you to change your tables' owner to socuser first:
	* To begin schema upgrade, please fix and rerun:
	  Must change table owner to socuser from postgres
  JSettlers comes with the script jsettlers-upg-prep-postgres-owner.sql
  to do so, in the same directory as the scripts mentioned in the
  Database Creation section of this README. As the postgres system user, run:

    psql -d socdata --file jsettlers-upg-prep-postgres-owner.sql -v to=socuser
	
  Then, run the schema upgrade command.
- Test that you can connect and start games as usual, with and without bots.
  When you connect make sure the version number shown in the left side of
  the client window is the new JSettlers version.

### Database Setup

If you want to maintain user accounts or save scores of all completed games,
you will need to set up a MySQL, SQLite, or PostgreSQL database. This will
eliminate the "No user database available" console message seen when starting
the server.

This section first describes setting up the database and the JSettlers server's
connection to it, and then how to turn on optional features for Game Scores
or User Accounts.

For these instructions we'll assume you already installed the PostgreSQL or
MySQL software, or will download a SQLite JAR to avoid database server setup.
JSettlers is tested with sqlite 3.7, mysql 5.5, and postgresql 8.4 and 9.5.

You will need a JDBC driver JAR file in your classpath or the same directory as
the JSettlers JAR, see below for details. Besides PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite
any JDBC database can be used, including Oracle or MS SQL Server; however only
those three db types are tested in depth with JSettlers.

The default type and name for the database is MySQL and "socdata". To use
another db type or another name, you'll need to specify it as a JDBC URL on
the command line, such as:

	-Djsettlers.db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/socdata

or

	-Djsettlers.db.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/socdata

or

	-Djsettlers.db.url=jdbc:sqlite:jsettlers.sqlite

If needed you can also specify a database username and password as:

	-Djsettlers.db.user=socuser -Djsettlers.db.pass=socpass

or place them on the command line after the port number and max connections:

	$ java -jar JSettlersServer.jar -Djsettlers.db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/socdata -Djsettlers.db.jar=mysql-connector-java-5.1.34-bin.jar 8880 20 socuser socpass

Finding a JDBC driver JAR:

The default JDBC driver is com.mysql.jdbc.Driver.  PostgreSQL and SQLite are also
recognized.  To use PostgreSQL, use a postgresql URL like the one shown above,
or specify the driver on the SOCServer command line:

	-Djsettlers.db.driver=org.postgresql.Driver

To use SQLite, use a sqlite url like the one shown above, or specify a
sqlite driver such as:

	-Djsettlers.db.driver=org.sqlite.JDBC

If a database URL is given but SOCServer can't connect to the database,
it won't continue startup.

Depending on your computer's setup, you may need to point JSettlers at the
appropriate JDBC drivers, by placing them in your java classpath.
Your database system's JDBC drivers can be downloaded at these locations:

- MySQL:   http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/
- PostgreSQL:  http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html
- SQLite:  https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/downloads/

In some cases, adding to the classpath won't work because of JVM restrictions
about JAR files.  If you find that's the case, place the JDBC jar in the same
location as JSettlersServer.jar, and specify on the jsettlers command line:

	-Djsettlers.db.jar=sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar

(sqlite jar filename may vary, update the parameter to match it).


#### Database Creation

To create the jsettlers database and its db user `('socuser')` and security,
execute the SQL db scripts located in `src/bin/sql/`
(included in `jsettlers-2.x.xx-full.tar.gz`): Change to that directory
and follow the instructions here for your database type. Afterwards,
see above for instructions on starting the JSettlers server and connecting
to the database.

If you downloaded the JAR and not the full tar.gz, you can get the SQL scripts
from https://github.com/jdmonin/JSettlers2/tree/master/src/bin/sql .
To get each script needed for your DB type: Click the SQL file to view it;
click Raw; save to the folder containing your JSettlers JAR.

For mysql:
Run these commands, which will ask for the mysql root password:

    $ mysql -u root -p -e "SOURCE jsettlers-create-mysql.sql"
    $ mysql -u root -D socdata -p -e "SOURCE jsettlers-tables-mysql.sql"

If the scripts run without any errors, they will produce no output.
To validate, you can list tables with this command:

    $ mysql -u root -D socdata -p -e "show tables"
	+-------------------+
	| Tables_in_socdata |
	+-------------------+
	| db_version        |
	| games             |
	| logins            |
	| robotparams       |
	| settings          |
	| users             |
	+-------------------+

If mysql gives the error: Unknown character set: 'utf8mb4'
you will need to make a small change to jsettlers-create-mysql.sql
and re-run the commands; see comments at the top of that script.

For Postgresql:
Run these commands as the postgres system user:

    $ psql --file jsettlers-create-postgres.sql
    $ psql -d socdata --file jsettlers-sec-postgres.sql
    $ psql -d socdata -U socuser -h 127.0.0.1 --file jsettlers-tables-postgres.sql
    Password for user socuser: socpass

If the scripts run without any errors, they will produce very terse output
such as `CREATE DATABASE`, `CREATE TABLE`, and `NOTICE`:
CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index".
You can validate by listing the newly created tables with this command:

    $ psql -d socdata -c '\dt'
	            List of relations
	 Schema |    Name     | Type  |  Owner
	--------+-------------+-------+----------
	 public | db_version  | table | socuser
	 public | games       | table | socuser
	 public | logins      | table | socuser
	 public | robotparams | table | socuser
	 public | settings    | table | socuser
	 public | users       | table | socuser

When you start your JSettlers server, remember to specify the postgres DB using:
  `-Djsettlers.db.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/socdata`
You may also need to specify a `jsettlers.db.jar` value as noted in the
"JDBC driver" section.

For sqlite:
Copy `jsettlers-tables-sqlite.sql` to the same directory as `JSettlersServer.jar`
and `sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar` and run this command (sqlite jar filename may
vary, update the jsettlers.db.jar parameter to match it):

    $ java -jar JSettlersServer.jar -Djsettlers.db.jar=sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar  -Djsettlers.db.url=jdbc:sqlite:jsettlers.sqlite  -Djsettlers.db.script.setup=jsettlers-tables-sqlite.sql

You should see this message:

	DB setup script was successful. Exiting now.

This will create a `jsettlers.sqlite` file containing the empty tables.
This script will fail if the file and tables already exist.
Later when you start your JSettlers server, remember to specify the sqlite DB
using the same `-Djsettlers.db.url` and `-Djsettlers.db.jar` values.

### Storing Game Scores in the DB (optional)

Game scores can optionally be saved for reports or community-building. To
automatically save all completed game results in the database, use this option
when starting the JSettlers server:

	-Djsettlers.db.save.games=Y

Or, in your server's jsserver.properties file, add the line:

	jsettlers.db.save.games=Y

Optional: Creating JSettlers Player Accounts in the DB:

To create player accounts, run the simple account creation client with the
following command:

	java -cp JSettlers.jar soc.client.SOCAccountClient yourserver.example.com 8880

Users with accounts must type their password to log into the server to play.
People without accounts can still connect by leaving the password field blank,
as long as they aren't using a nickname which has a password in the database.

For security we recommend that you set the jsettlers.accounts.admins property,
otherwise any user account can create others. See below for more details on
listing admin usernames in that property.

In versions before 1.1.19, anyone could create their own user accounts
(open registration). In 1.1.19 this default was changed to improve security:
An existing user must log in before creating any new account.  If you still
want to allow open registration of user accounts, include this option when
you start your server:

	-Djsettlers.accounts.open=y

When you first set up the database, there won't be any user accounts, so the
server will allow anyone to create the first account.  Please be sure to
create that first user account soon after you set up the database.

### Password Encryption (BCrypt)

Player account passwords are encrypted using BCrypt. For tuning, BCrypt includes
a "Work Factor" parameter; the hashing algorithm runs for 2 ^ WorkFactor rounds,
so a larger Work Factor is tougher to brute-force attack but runs slower on
your server.

The default Work Factor for JSettlers is 12. To use a different value set the
`jsettlers.db.bcrypt.work_factor` property on the server command line or in
`jsserver.properties`. Each account's Work Factor is stored with its encrypted
password; changing the Work Factor property affects future passwords but not
already-encrypted ones.

To test the speed of different work factors on your server, run JSettlersServer
once with `-Djsettlers.db.bcrypt.work_factor=test` , which will try a range of
work factors and print the timed results.

If you're upgrading from a version before 1.2.00, you will need to upgrade your
database schema in order to use BCrypt. Test bcrypt speed and set the
work_factor property before starting the upgrade process.


### Security and Admin Users

If you want to require that all players have accounts and passwords, include
this option when you start your server:

	-Djsettlers.accounts.required=y

To permit only certain users to create new accounts, instead of all users,
list them when you start your server:

	-Djsettlers.accounts.admins=bob,joe,lily
	
This creates a whitelist of Account Admin Users. Account admins can create
accounts and run user-related commands, such as listing all users in a game with

	*WHO* gamename
	
or listing all users connected to the server with

	*WHO* *
	
For a list of all available commands, type

	*HELP*
	
into the chat window of any game while connected as an admin user.

Note:
The server doesn't require or check at startup that the named accounts all
already exist, the whitelist is only a comma-separated list of names. This
simplifies initial setup.

In case an admin account password is lost, there's a rudimentary password-reset feature:
Run JSettlersServer with the usual DB parameters and add: --pw-reset username
You will be prompted for username's new password. This command can be run while
the server is up. It will reset the password and exit, and won't start a second
JSettlersServer.
