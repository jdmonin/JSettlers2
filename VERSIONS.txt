Unless otherwise indicated, versions are hosted at http://nand.net/jsettlers/devel/
and (most versions) at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsettlers2/files/

    > 1.1.09 (build 20100xxx)
- 4-player board: crisper graphics (images from 6-player board)
- Practice games don't expire (Rowan H idea)
- Show rounds remaining for "roll no 7s during first n turns" (Rowan H idea)
- When moving robber and choosing a victim, popup shows their # VPs

     Also allowed at start of own turn, only if not rolled or played card yet,
     and not when you are the first player taking your first turn.
- 6-player: During Special Building Phase, a player can ask to Special Build after
     the phase has begun, even if this means we temporarily go
     backwards in turn order.  (Normal turn order resumes at the
     end of the SBP.)  The board game does not allow this out-of-order building.
- 6-player robots: Slow down a little: Pause 75% of 4-player's pause duration, not 50%
- At end of game, hilight winner with yellow arrow
- At end of game, show number of rounds along with time elapsed

	from: Client version 1107 or higher is required for these game options.
	to :  Client version 1.1.07 or newer is required for these game options.
- Double-clicking your face icon brings up the Face Chooser
- Allow 3rd-party Robot AIs, via new rbclass param in IMAROBOT message, SOCClientData.isBuiltInRobot
	Print robot type on connect (built-in, or rbclass name)
- Fix: Ask 2nd practice game options, when 1st is over but its window still showing
- Fix: For game's 1st client, set game.clientVersionLowest (was always 0 before now)
- 6-player window: Before expanding chat area when mouse enters it,
	wait 200 ms (not 100 ms) in case mouse is just passing through.
- Debug assist: SOCBoardLayout2 prints array contents
- Other changes: TBD ?
