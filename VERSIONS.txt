[ The list of the different public versions of JSettlers ]

Unless otherwise indicated, versions are hosted at http://nand.net/jsettlers/devel/
and (recent versions) at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsettlers2/files/
and source history at https://github.com/jdmonin/JSettlers2

From 1.0 up through 1.1.13, there is a single line of development.

Right after 1.1.13, new development branch 2.0.00 split off; further 1.1.xx
versions are stable-branch releases to bring out bugfixes and backport minor
new features, until 2.0.00 is ready.



    > 1.1.19 (build OV2014xxxx)
- New game option "N7C" for house rule: Roll no 7s until a city is built
- Bugfix when new client sits during first initial-settlement placement round
- Bugfix: potential roads now allowed next to opponent's newly placed settlement, if player already has a road touching the potential road
- Trading port/harbor graphics refreshed for directional clarity and scaling
- Reset board during initial placement: Pick randomly-selected robots, instead of keeping same robots
- Reset board: If only 1 human player, don't reset if all bots are locked

- Client Connect to Server, Start Server screens: If port number field is empty, use default 8880
- Bugfix in version tracking when player joins and replaces only bot in a game in progress
- Bots connecting require a security cookie, randomly generated at server startup.
     The built-in bots started automatically by SOCServer will know the cookie value.
     To set the cookie to a given value, set the jsettlers.bots.cookie parameter.
     To print the cookie value in order to connect other bots, use -Djsettlers.bots.showcookie=Y when starting the server.
- Server stats include client versions seen since startup
- Server command line game option settings: Also allow y or Y for boolean options
- Server command line: Exit if any -D or -o parameter appears more than once

     the phase has begun, even if this means we temporarily go
